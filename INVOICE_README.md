## Data Models

### Invoice Entity

```typescript
{
  id: string; // UUID
  invoice_number: string; // Unique invoice number (INV-YYYYMM-XXXX)
  amount: number; // Base service amount
  tax_amount: number; // Tax amount
  total_amount: number; // Total amount (amount + tax)
  status: InvoiceStatus; // Current status
  due_date: Date; // Payment due date
  sent_at: Date; // When invoice was sent
  paid_at: Date; // When payment was received
  notes: string; // Additional notes
  pdf_url: string; // URL to PDF invoice (future feature)
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;

  // Relations
  booking: Booking; // Associated booking
  payment: Payment; // Associated payment (if paid)
  customer: User; // Customer who receives the invoice
}
```

### Create Invoice DTO

```typescript
{
  booking_id: string          // Required: UUID of the booking
  customer_id: string         // Required: UUID of the customer
  tax_amount?: number         // Optional: Tax amount (default: 0)
  due_date?: string          // Optional: Due date (default: 30 days from creation)
  notes?: string             // Optional: Additional notes
}
```

## Email Templates

### Invoice Email

- Professional layout with service details
- Amount breakdown (service amount, tax, total)
- Due date information
- Custom notes if provided
- Branding consistent with CarWash service

### Payment Confirmation Email

- Payment success notification
- Invoice and payment details
- Service information
- Thank you message

## Automatic Workflows

### Payment Completion Workflow

1. Payment status changes to "COMPLETED" (M-Pesa or Stripe)
2. System checks if invoice exists for the booking
3. If no invoice exists, creates one automatically
4. Marks invoice as "PAID" and links to payment
5. Sets `paid_at` timestamp
6. Sends payment confirmation email to customer

### Manual Invoice Creation

1. Admin creates invoice via API
2. Invoice status is set to "PENDING"
3. Admin can mark invoice as "SENT" to trigger email
4. When payment is received, invoice is marked as "PAID"

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
EMAIL=your-smtp-email@example.com
PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
```

### Email Service

The system uses NodeMailer with Gmail SMTP. Make sure to:

1. Enable 2-factor authentication on Gmail
2. Generate an app-specific password
3. Use the app password in the `PASSWORD` environment variable

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Invoice

```typescript
const invoice = await invoiceService.create({
  booking_id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  customer_id: '987fcdeb-51a2-43d1-b1f4-426614174999',
  tax_amount: 5.0,
  due_date: '2025-08-21',
  notes: 'Car wash service - Premium package',
});
```

### Sending an Invoice

```typescript
// This will update status to SENT and send email
const invoice = await invoiceService.markAsSent(invoiceId);
```

### Marking as Paid

```typescript
// This will update status to PAID and send confirmation email
const invoice = await invoiceService.markAsPaid(invoiceId, paymentId);
